    <h2>Part One: Historical Racial and Socioecnomic Divide in St. Louis</h2>
    <div class="body-container">
      <p>St. Louis is one of the most segregated cities in the United States, and in St. Louis, it is no better exemplified than through the Delmar Divide. North of St. Louis's Delmar Boulevard is 95% black. South of it is two-thirds white (Cooperman).And not surprisingly, the northern part fares off worse economically and socially. None of this is coincidental; it is a result of a deliberate effort by racist institutions that it has turned out this way.<br> <br> In 1900, St. Louis had more than 35,000 African-American residents, second only to Baltimore (Cooperman). Many white workers feared that they were taking away jobs, or that lower-paid workers would decrease the value of houses. Because of this economic tension, racist policies developed.</br><br>

      <p> One of the first attempts was that St. Louis passed a reform ordinance, prohibiting anyone from buying a home in a neighborhood that was occupied by 75% of another race. SCOTUS striked this ordinance down, but racial covenants, which asked every family to sign a document agreeing to not sell their property to a black person, were still legal until 1948. Nevertheless, all this had effects in maintaining segregation in St. Louis.</br><br>
        Another method the government used to maintain segregation was eminent domain. In building highways and infrastructure, the government would purposely build it through African-American communities, essentially destroying them. The displaced residents were sometimes then given vouchers to live in public housing, such as the infamous Pruitt-Igoe, which basically moved entire populations of African-Americans. Some places were declared "slums" and therefore dangerous, and the governent destroyed those places.<br><br>

        There was segregation, but there was also different treatment of the the black and white communities that were segregated.  The government played a role in criminalizing the black parts of St. Louis. Local zoning policies allocated areas, which tended to be more populated by African-Americans, as "slums" or "ghettos" and thus needed more policing and "nuisance codes."</br><br>
        All these factors led to the segregation and socioeconomic divide one sees in St. Louis over time and history.</p><br><br>
